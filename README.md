The Deliverable is divided into two files:

* **fashion_MNIST**: where the first part is addressed. The aim is to train a model that uses a particular grouping of the predefined classes in  FASHION-MNIST Following this structure:

    - Exploratory analysis
    - Dataset generation according to the 
    model's requirements
    - Model declaration
    - Model training
    - Results analysis

* **SQL_query**: where the requested query is carried out, following an incremental approach with some comments.



 Python version used: 3.11.5

For the execution of the notebook, it is recommended to create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies for execution:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
````
For the download and use of data, it has been decided to, use the repository of [FASHION-MNIST]((https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)), add it to the path, and install the subdependencies of this project. All these steps are executed at the beginning of the notebook.
